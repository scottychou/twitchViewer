An application that quickly displays a list of my favorite twitch.tv streamers via the Twitch.tv API and ability to filter for online/offline streamers .   

Upon clicking a streamer, the page is filled with statistics and images of the stream, based on the width of the window - I designed this responsively with custom breakpoints and pure vanilla CSS.

This is a 100% Front End Project to display my HTML5,CSS3, SCSS and JavaScript/JQuery ability.
